`/media/conf/couchpotato` is the folder on the host where you will store couchpotato configurations  
`/media/Movies` is the folder on the host where you will store completed and organized downloads  
`/media/Unsorted` is the folder on the host where you will store complete files waiting to be organized  
`/media/blackhole` is... just in case you need to plug a blackhole listener
